# SPI-IN-PI42TAS
C code for Inolux IN-PI42TAS RGB 4-Pin LED on a STM32 Chip. The primary drive mechanism utilizes an SPI interface MOSI pin clocked at 6.25MHz. Allows for chaining RGB LEDs in succession. Uses 8 bits per 1 bit period. This was also tested on P/Ns LTST-E263CEGBK and IN-PI55TATPRPGPB. Some LEDs might flip the 24-bit protocol (RGB vs GRB, etc.). It's up to the user to feed the correct data.
